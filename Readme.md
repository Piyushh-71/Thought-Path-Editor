📦 ThoughtPath Editor
“Turn Thoughts Into Design.”

A minimal, premium, Figma-inspired visual editor built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, no frameworks.

🚀 Overview

ThoughtPath Editor is a fully interactive, modular design tool created from scratch using vanilla web technologies.
It transforms free-flowing ideas into structured visual layouts through a clean interface, precise controls, and a polished dark UI theme.

This project replicates the core functionalities of design tools like Figma, Framer, and Linear, but built entirely with hand-crafted DOM manipulation and modular JavaScript architecture.
